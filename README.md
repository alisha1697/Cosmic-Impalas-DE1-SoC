# ðŸš€ Cosmic Impalas: DE1-SoC Final Project

**Author:** Alisha Siddiqui  
**Course:** CPEN 412 @ University of British Columbia  
**Project:** Porting and implementing the Cosmic Impalas arcade game on a DE1-SoC FPGA system.


## ðŸ•¹ Project Overview

This project involved porting the **Cosmic Impalas** retro arcade game, originally written for the Midway8080 platform, onto a custom hardware and software system based on the **Motorola 68000 (M68K)** CPU running on the **DE1-SoC** FPGA.

The implementation required integrating:
- A VGA graphics subsystem
- A custom pixel buffer memory
- A memory adapter to convert 1-bit Midway8080 graphics to 30-bit RGB format
- Embedded C software to run the game logic


## ðŸ›  Main Components

- **FPGA Hardware**
  - VGA pixel buffer memory (custom dual-port and shadow memories)
  - Midway8080 memory adapter (combinational logic)
  - SDRAM controller for program memory
  - Hardware timer for clock generation via interrupts

- **Embedded Software**
  - Ported game logic (`cosmic_impalas.c`)
  - Graphics test program (`graphics_test.c`)
  - Hardware timer interrupt handling
  - Display control and player input via hyperterminal
